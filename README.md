# Stella protocol

Stella protocol offers lending (like Aave or Compound) and various leveraged strategies building on top of major DeFi protocols (like Uniswap, Convex, Yearn, and many more coming soon).

Stella strategy users can borrow funds from Stella lending pools at _0% borrow interest rate_ to open a position to execute any of the whitelisted strategies. Instead of paying borrow interest on the borrowed assets, strategy users will share a portion of their profit to lenders when they close their positions (only in case there is a yield).

Stella protocol consists of 2 main parts:

1. _Stella Lending_: Lenders can lend their tokens (eg. USDC, ETH, DAI, ...). to earn shared yield from strategy users.
2. _Stella Strategies_: Strategy users can execute leveraged strategies on our whitelisted strategies by borrowing tokens from Stella Lending.
